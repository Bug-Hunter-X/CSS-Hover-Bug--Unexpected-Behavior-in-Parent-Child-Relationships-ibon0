# CSS Hover Bug: Unexpected Behavior in Parent-Child Relationships

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the unexpected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class within a parent-child relationship.  The issue arises from the specificity of CSS selectors and how the browser handles cascading styles.

## Bug Description

The code includes a parent element and a child element. The intention is that when the parent element is hovered, both the parent and the child elements change their background colors. However, due to specificity issues or other CSS conflicts, the child element might not change color as expected.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and `bugSolution.css` to observe the buggy and fixed code.
3. Open `bug.html` (or create your own HTML file that links to `bug.css`) in a web browser.
4. Hover over the parent element. Notice how the child's background does not always change as intended in `bug.css`

## Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.css`, addresses the issue by ensuring that the child's hover style has sufficient specificity to override any conflicting styles. This might involve more specific selectors, changing the order of CSS rules, or using `!important` (though generally discouraged for maintainability)
