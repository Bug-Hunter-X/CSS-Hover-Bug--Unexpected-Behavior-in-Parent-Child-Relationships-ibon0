The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to unexpected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class within a parent-child relationship. The issue stems from the specificity of CSS selectors and how the browser handles cascading styles.

```css
.parent {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.parent:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.parent .child {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.parent:hover .child {
  background-color: lightpink;
}
```

The intended behavior is that when the parent element is hovered, both the parent and the child elements should change their background color. However, depending on the browser and other CSS rules, the child element's hover state might not be applied correctly, especially if there are conflicting styles or specificity issues.

This error can be particularly tricky to debug because it involves an interaction between the parent's hover state and the child's styling, often leading to unexpected results without thorough investigation.
